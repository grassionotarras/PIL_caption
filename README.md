# Things to note
- Change the path if you are on a different os to a font.
- If you don't have any fonts then download one.
- Put the image inside the folder where your **python file** is at and name it just img
- PIL(The library that manipulates the image) supports a lot of image types but it might not support yours. If that happens try converting your image to a more common type like .png or .jpg.


*this is not a serious project, just something I wanted to do for fun and learning pillow/PIL a little more.*
